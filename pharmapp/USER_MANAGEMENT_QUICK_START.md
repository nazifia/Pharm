## 🛡️ Security & Permissions

### Available Decorators
Use these decorators to protect your views:

```python
from userauth.decorators import role_required, permission_required

@role_required(['Admin', 'Manager'])
def sensitive_view(request):
    # Only accessible to Admins and Managers
    pass

@permission_required('manage_inventory')
def inventory_view(request):
    # Only accessible to users with inventory management permission
    pass
```

### Template Permission Checks
Use these in your templates:

```html
{% if can_manage_users %}
    <a href="{% url 'userauth:user_list' %}">Manage Users</a>
{% endif %}

{% if is_admin %}
    <div class="admin-only-content">...</div>
{% endif %}
```

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Permissions
1. Edit `userauth/models.py`
2. Add new permissions to the `USER_PERMISSIONS` dictionary
3. Update role assignments as needed
4. Create and run migrations if needed

### Adding New User Types
1. Update `USER_TYPE` choices in `userauth/models.py`
2. Add permission mappings in `USER_PERMISSIONS`

### Customizing Templates
All templates are located in `templates/userauth/`:
- `user_list.html` - User management dashboard
- `user_details.html` - User detail pages
- `privilege_management.html` - Privilege management interface
- `register.html` - User registration form

## 📊 Monitoring & Maintenance

### Activity Logs
