# Customer Performance Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of registered customer performance tracking for monthly and yearly reports in the PharmApp system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Core Analytics Functions
- **`get_monthly_customer_performance(start_date, end_date)`**: Aggregates customer performance data by month
- **`get_yearly_customer_performance(start_year, end_year)`**: Aggregates customer performance data by year

### 2. Performance Metrics Tracked
For each customer (both retail and wholesale), the system tracks:
- Total purchase amount
- Number of transactions
- Total items purchased
- Average transaction value
- First and last purchase dates (yearly reports)
- Customer type (retail/wholesale)

### 3. Web Interface Views
- **Monthly Customer Performance** (`/monthly_customer_performance/`)
  - Filterable by date range
  - Summary statistics cards
  - Separate sections for retail and wholesale customers
  - Export to CSV functionality
  
- **Yearly Customer Performance** (`/yearly_customer_performance/`)
  - Filterable by year range
  - Includes customer lifecycle data (first/last purchase)
  - Summary statistics and export capabilities

### 4. Navigation Integration
Added navigation links in the main sidebar under "Reports & Analytics":
- Monthly Customer Performance
- Yearly Customer Performance

### 5. Management Command Enhancement
Extended the `generate_sales_report` management command to include customer performance data:
- Console output shows top performing customers
- CSV export includes customer performance file
- UTF-8 encoding support for international currency symbols

### 6. Template Features
Both templates include:
- Bootstrap-styled responsive design
- Filter controls for date/year ranges
- Summary statistics cards
- Sortable data tables
- Export to CSV functionality
- Links to individual customer history pages

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Queries
- Uses Django ORM aggregation and annotation for efficient queries
- Excludes returned items from performance calculations
- Handles both retail and wholesale customer data
- Optimized with proper indexing and select_related

### Data Structure
```python
{
    'customer_id': int,
    'customer_name': str,
    'customer_type': 'retail' or 'wholesale',
    'total_amount': Decimal,
    'transaction_count': int,
    'total_items': int,
    'avg_transaction': Decimal,
    'first_purchase': date,  # yearly only
    'last_purchase': date    # yearly only
}
```

### Security & Permissions
- All views require admin-level permissions (`@user_passes_test(is_admin)`)
- Follows existing authentication patterns
- Secure data handling and validation

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
1. `templates/store/monthly_customer_performance.html`
2. `templates/store/yearly_customer_performance.html`
3. `test_customer_performance.py` (test script)
4. `CUSTOMER_PERFORMANCE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (this document)

### Modified Files
1. `store/views.py` - Added analytics functions and view functions
2. `store/urls.py` - Added URL patterns for new views
3. `templates/partials/base.html` - Added navigation links
4. `store/management/commands/generate_sales_report.py` - Enhanced with customer performance

## Usage Examples

### Web Interface
1. Navigate to Reports & Analytics â†’ Monthly Customer Performance
2. Set date range filters (optional)
3. View customer performance data organized by month
4. Export to CSV for further analysis

### Management Command
```bash
# Generate monthly report with customer performance
python manage.py generate_sales_report --period monthly --format both

# Generate yearly report
python manage.py generate_sales_report --period yearly --format csv
```

### API Access
The analytics functions can be used programmatically:
```python
from store.views import get_monthly_customer_performance, get_yearly_customer_performance

# Get last 6 months of customer performance
monthly_data = get_monthly_customer_performance(start_date, end_date)

# Get last 3 years of customer performance
yearly_data = get_yearly_customer_performance(2022, 2024)
```

## Testing
- Comprehensive test suite in `test_customer_performance.py`
- Tests both functions with real and sample data
- Validates database queries and data structure
- All tests pass successfully

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient database queries using aggregation
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Optimized for both retail and wholesale operations
- Excludes returned items to maintain accuracy

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements could include:
- Customer segmentation analysis
- Trend analysis and forecasting
- Customer lifetime value calculations
- Integration with marketing campaigns
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Chart visualizations for performance trends

## Compatibility
- Compatible with existing PharmApp architecture
- Follows Django best practices
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Supports both retail and wholesale operations
- Unicode support for international currency symbols

## Conclusion
The customer performance tracking implementation provides comprehensive analytics for both monthly and yearly periods, enabling better business intelligence and customer relationship management in the PharmApp system.
