# Cart Clearing Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The user reported that a sale was made by a superuser for a customer, but the cart was cleared even though no receipt was generated. The issue was that transactions/sales records were being created and cart clearing was happening regardless of whether a receipt was actually generated.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Sales Creation Before Receipt**: In the `select_items` function, `Sales` objects were being created when items were selected for purchase, but before any receipt was generated.
2. **Cart Clearing Logic**: The `clear_cart` function was looking for sales WITHOUT receipts and clearing the cart anyway, which was incorrect behavior.
3. **Orphaned Sales Records**: When users selected items but didn't generate receipts, orphaned `Sales` objects remained in the database.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified `clear_cart` Function (store/views.py)
**Key Changes:**
- **Receipt-Based Logic**: Cart is only cleared when there are `Sales` objects WITH receipts (completed transactions)
- **Orphaned Sales Cleanup**: Sales records without receipts are cleaned up but cart is preserved
- **Customer-Specific Isolation**: Only affects the specific customer's session, not all customers
- **Preserved Functionality**: Stock returns and refund logic remain intact

**New Logic Flow:**
```python
# Check for completed sales (WITH receipts)
completed_sales = Sales.objects.filter(
    user=request.user,
    customer=current_customer,
    receipts__isnull=False  # Sales that have receipts
).distinct()

# Check for pending sales (WITHOUT receipts)  
pending_sales = Sales.objects.filter(
    user=request.user,
    customer=current_customer,
    receipts__isnull=True  # Sales without receipts
).distinct()

if completed_sales.exists():
    # Clear cart - receipts were generated
    cart_items.delete()
else:
    # Don't clear cart - no receipts generated
    # Just clean up orphaned sales records
    for sale in pending_sales:
        sale.sales_items.all().delete()
        sale.delete()
```

### 2. Modified `clear_wholesale_cart` Function (wholesale/views.py)
Applied the same fix to wholesale cart clearing with appropriate model references:
- Uses `wholesale_receipts__isnull=False/True` for receipt checking
- Uses `WholesaleCustomer` and `WholesaleCustomerWallet` models
- Same logic flow as retail cart clearing

### 3. Customer Session Isolation
- Uses `get_user_customer_id(request)` to get current customer from session
- Only processes transactions for the specific customer
- Prevents cross-customer data interference

## Benefits of the Fix

### 1. Correct Transaction Handling
- ✅ Cart only cleared when receipts are generated
- ✅ No transactions recorded without receipts
- ✅ Orphaned sales records properly cleaned up

### 2. Customer-Specific Operations
- ✅ Only affects the selected customer's cart
- ✅ Preserves other customers' sessions
- ✅ Maintains proper session isolation

### 3. Preserved Existing Functionality
- ✅ Stock return logic intact
- ✅ Wallet refund system preserved
- ✅ Transaction history maintained
- ✅ Error handling preserved

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: No Receipt Generated
**Before Fix:**
- Sales record created → Cart cleared → Customer confused

**After Fix:**
- Sales record created → No receipt → Orphaned sales cleaned up → Cart preserved

### Scenario 2: Receipt Generated
**Before & After Fix:**
- Sales record created → Receipt generated → Cart cleared → Customer satisfied

### Scenario 3: Multiple Customers
**Before Fix:**
- Could affect multiple customers' carts

**After Fix:**
- Only affects the specific customer's session

## Files Modified
1. `pharmapp/store/views.py` - `clear_cart` function (lines 677-817)
2. `pharmapp/wholesale/views.py` - `clear_wholesale_cart` function (lines 1214-1354)

## Key Code Changes

### Retail Cart Clearing
```python
# OLD: Always cleared cart regardless of receipts
sales_entries = Sales.objects.filter(
    receipts__isnull=True  # Found pending sales and cleared anyway
)

# NEW: Only clear when receipts exist
completed_sales = Sales.objects.filter(
    receipts__isnull=False  # Only clear when receipts exist
)
if completed_sales.exists():
    cart_items.delete()  # Clear only when receipts generated
```

### Customer Isolation
```python
# NEW: Customer-specific operations
customer_id = get_user_customer_id(request)
current_customer = Customer.objects.get(id=customer_id)

# Filter by specific customer
completed_sales = Sales.objects.filter(
    user=request.user,
    customer=current_customer,  # Customer-specific
    receipts__isnull=False
)
```

## Impact
- **User Experience**: Cart is preserved when no receipt is generated
- **Data Integrity**: No orphaned sales records
- **Session Management**: Proper customer isolation
- **Business Logic**: Transactions only recorded when receipts exist

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to existing workflows
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
