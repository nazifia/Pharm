# Select Item Return Functionality Enhancements

## Overview
Enhanced the return logic for both retail and wholesale registered customers when returning items via the "Select Item" button in customer lists. The system now properly captures, records, and indicates if items are dispensed or returned, and automatically refunds the deducted amount to the customer's wallet.

## Key Enhancements Made

### 1. **Fixed Wholesale Return Transaction History**
- **Issue**: Wholesale returns via select item were missing transaction history creation
- **Solution**: Added `TransactionHistory.objects.create()` calls in both wholesale return functions
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `pharmapp/wholesale/views.py` (lines 826-833, 1520-1527)

### 2. **Enhanced Return Logic Consistency**
- **Issue**: Inconsistent return logic between retail and wholesale
- **Solution**: Ensured both retail and wholesale have complete return tracking:
  - ✅ Dispensing log creation
  - ✅ Wallet refund logic
  - ✅ Transaction history creation
  - ✅ Sales record updates
  - ✅ Stock adjustments

### 3. **Fixed URL Routing**
- **Issue**: Wholesale return URL had double "wholesale" prefix
- **Solution**: Fixed URL pattern from `wholesale/return_items/<int:pk>/` to `return_items/<int:pk>/`
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `pharmapp/wholesale/urls.py` (line 76)

### 4. **Comprehensive Return Status Tracking**
- **Enhancement**: Added detailed return summary properties to dispensing logs
- **Features**:
  - Return percentage calculations
  - Detailed status indicators (Fully returned, Partially returned, No returns)
  - Comprehensive return summaries with remaining quantities
- **Files Modified**:
  - `pharmapp/store/models.py` (lines 269-335)
  - `pharmapp/templates/partials/partials_dispensing_log.html`
  - `pharmapp/templates/store/user_dispensing_details.html`
