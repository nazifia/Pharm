# Wholesale Receipt Customer Display Fix

## Problem
The wholesale receipt was displaying "Walk-in Customer" even when a registered customer was selected during the item selection process.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was identified in the `wholesale_receipt` function in `wholesale/views.py`. While the wholesale customer was being properly retrieved from the session and assigned to the sales object and receipt during creation, there were potential points where the customer information could be lost:

1. **Session Management**: The `wholesale_customer_id` stored in session could be cleared by the `cleanup_cart_session_after_receipt` function
2. **Data Integrity**: There were cases where the `wholesale_customer` relationship could be set to None between creation and rendering
3. **Debugging Visibility**: Insufficient logging made it difficult to track where the customer information was being lost

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Session Debugging
Added comprehensive logging to track the wholesale customer session state throughout the process:

```python
# In select_wholesale_items
print(f"Debug - Storing wholesale_customer_id in session: {customer.id} for customer: {customer.name}")
print(f"Debug - Session keys after customer selection: {list(request.session.keys())}")

# In wholesale_receipt  
print(f"Debug - Found wholesale customer from session: {wholesale_customer.name}")
print(f"Debug - Session keys: {list(request.session.keys())}")
```

### 2. Data Recovery Mechanisms
Added recovery logic to ensure the wholesale customer is preserved even if there are issues with session or database operations:

```python
# Recovery for Sales object
if not sales.wholesale_customer and wholesale_customer_id:
    try:
        recovered_customer = WholesaleCustomer.objects.get(id=wholesale_customer_id)
        sales.wholesale_customer = recovered_customer
        sales.save()

# Recovery for Receipt object  
if not receipt.wholesale_customer and wholesale_customer_id:
    try:
        recovered_customer = WholesaleCustomer.objects.get(id=wholesale_customer_id)
        receipt.wholesale_customer = recovered_customer
        receipt.buyer_name = recovered_customer.name
        receipt.buyer_address = recovered_customer.address
        receipt.save()
```

### 3. Session Cleanup Optimization
Temporarily disabled session cleanup to preserve the wholesale customer ID during debugging:

```python
# Skip session cleanup for now to preserve wholesale_customer_id for debugging
# TODO: Re-enable after fixing customer display issue
# from store.cart_utils import cleanup_cart_session_after_receipt
```

### 4. Enhanced Template Debugging
Added final debugging before template rendering to ensure the customer data is properly passed to the template:

```python
print(f"Final receipt.wholesale_customer: {receipt.wholesale_customer}")
if receipt.wholesale_customer:
    print(f"Customer name should display: {receipt.wholesale_customer.name}")
else:
    print("WARNING: receipt.wholesale_customer is None - will show 'Walk-in Customer'")
```

## Key Changes Made

### Files Modified
1. `wholesale/views.py` - Enhanced `select_wholesale_items` and `wholesale_receipt` functions

### Functions Enhanced
1. **select_wholesale_items** (line ~980)
   - Added session debugging when storing customer ID

2. **wholesale_receipt** (line ~1569)
   - Enhanced customer retrieval with debugging
   - Added recovery mechanisms for Sales and Receipt objects
   - Added final debugging before template rendering
   - Temporarily disabled session cleanup

### Template Validation
The wholesale receipt template (`wholesale/wholesale_receipt.html`) logic is correct and should properly display the customer name:

```html
<input type="text" id="buyer_name" name="buyer_name"
    value="{% if receipt.wholesale_customer %}{{ receipt.wholesale_customer.name|upper }}{% elif receipt.buyer_name %}{{ receipt.buyer_name|upper }}{% else %}WALK-IN CUSTOMER{% endif %}"
    {% if receipt.wholesale_customer %}readonly{% endif %}>
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Manual Testing Flow**:
   - Select a registered wholesale customer
   - Add items to cart
   - Proceed to checkout and generate receipt
   - Verify the customer name displays correctly on the receipt

2. **Debug Log Analysis**:
   - Check the Django logs for the debug output
   - Verify the customer ID is properly stored and retrieved from session
   - Confirm the receipt object has the wholesale_customer relationship set

3. **Database Validation**:
   - Check the WholesaleReceipt table to ensure wholesale_customer_id is populated
   - Verify the Sales table has the wholesale_customer relationship maintained

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Run the wholesale receipt generation process with a registered customer to validate the fix
2. **Log Analysis**: Review the debug output to identify any remaining issues
3. **Session Cleanup**: Re-enable session cleanup once the fix is confirmed working
4. **Debug Removal**: Remove debug print statements once the issue is resolved

## Potential Future Improvements

1. **Better Session Management**: Consider using a more robust session management system
2. **Transaction Safety**: Ensure the customer relationship is maintained within database transactions
3. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling when customer information cannot be retrieved
4. **Unit Testing**: Add automated tests for customer selection and receipt generation flows
