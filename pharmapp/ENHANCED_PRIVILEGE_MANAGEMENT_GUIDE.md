## Permission System Logic

### Role-Based Permissions
Each user role has default permissions:
- **Admin**: 24 permissions (full access)
- **Manager**: 19 permissions (operational management)
- **Pharmacist**: 11 permissions (pharmacy operations)
- **Pharm-Tech**: 10 permissions (technical support)
- **Salesperson**: 5 permissions (sales only)

### Individual Permission Overrides
- Individual permissions **override** role-based permissions
- You can grant additional permissions to any user
- You can revoke role-based permissions from specific users
- Changes are tracked with timestamps and admin notes

### Permission Sources
- **Role**: Permission comes from user's role
- **Individual**: Permission granted individually
- **Revoked**: Role permission revoked individually

## Security Features

### Access Control
- Only admin/superuser can access the privilege management system
- All permission changes are logged with timestamps
- User activity is tracked and auditable

### Permission Validation
- System validates all permission assignments
- Prevents unauthorized access attempts
- Maintains data integrity

### Activity Logging
- All permission changes are logged
- Includes who made the change and when
- Tracks both individual and bulk operations

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Role Templates First
- Start with appropriate role template
- Make individual adjustments as needed
- Avoid giving excessive permissions

### 2. Regular Permission Audits
- Review user permissions periodically
- Remove unnecessary permissions
- Use activity logs to track changes

### 3. Bulk Operations
- Use bulk management for team-wide changes
- Test with a few users before bulk operations
- Document major permission changes

### 4. Permission Documentation
- Keep notes on why specific permissions were granted
- Document any deviations from role standards
- Maintain permission change records

## Troubleshooting

### User Can't Access Feature
1. Check if user has required permission
2. Verify permission is granted (not revoked)
3. Check if role-based permission exists
4. Look for individual permission overrides

### Permission Changes Not Taking Effect
1. Ensure changes were saved
2. User may need to logout/login
3. Check for browser cache issues
4. Verify permission was granted correctly

### Bulk Operations Failed
1. Check if all selected users exist
2. Verify permission name is correct
3. Ensure admin has necessary privileges
4. Check system logs for errors
